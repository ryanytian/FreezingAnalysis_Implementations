# FreezingAnalysis_Implementations

This repository contains the implementations of ezTrack (ezTrack_FreezingAnalysis.ipynb) and OpenCV Object Tracker (ObjectTracker_FreezingAnalysis.ipynb) for freezing behaviour analysis. The functions used in the implementations (FreezeAnalysis_Functions.py) are adapted from the functions written by the author of ezTrack. The video ('Test_Video.m4v) used to generate the graphs in section 3 of the thesis document is included here as well.


NOTE: For a more extensive version of ezTrack that is able to batch process videos and contains the motion tracking module, please visit the original author's repository at https://github.com/DeniseCaiLab/ezTrack.




The training data set, evaluation results, and a sample labeled video using the trained neural network from DeepLabCut can also be found in this repository. See inside the folder 'DeepLabCut'.
