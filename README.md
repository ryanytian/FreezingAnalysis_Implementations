# FreezingAnalysis_Implementations

This repository contains the implementations of ezTrack and OpenCV Object Tracker for freezing behaviour analysis. The functions used in the implementations are adapted from the functions written by the author of ezTrack.

For a more extensive version of ezTrack that is able to batch process videos and contains the motion tracking module, please visit the original author's repository at https://github.com/DeniseCaiLab/ezTrack.

The training data set, evaluation results, and a sample labeled video using the trained neural network from DeepLabCut is also included here. See inside the folder 'DeepLabCut'.

To download the DeepLabCut software and for instructions of how to use the software, please visit http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut.
